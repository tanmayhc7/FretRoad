# Tests

They drive the real page in a headless Chromium with Playwright (`pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`, plus `numpy` for the audio fixtures).

```bash
cd tests
python3 mkwav.py            # one-off: generates fake guitar recordings in tests/out/
python3 ui_core.py          # chapter 1, quizzes, drills, metronome, mobile layout
